  # Fix User RLS Policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Allow anonymous users to insert new user records (needed for Telegram WebApp initial user creation)
    - Update existing policies to work with Supabase Auth
    - Ensure users can only access their own data after creation

  2. Changes Made
    - Add policy to allow anonymous inserts for initial user creation
    - Update existing policies to use proper auth functions
    - Maintain security while allowing necessary operations
